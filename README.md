Repository for F28WP. 

## About this Repository
This repository is for the F28WP course. Here you will find __HTML__, __CSS__ and mainly __JavaScript__. You will also be able to find examples of __JSON__, __XML__ and __AJAX__. This repository has been made to test my knowledge of GitHub and is assessed over the entirety of the course. Contents of the repository are listed below as well as a checklist so I can keep track of my progress on knowledge of GitHub.

You can also find the course contents at the bottom of this file so you can see what is used within the files within this repository.

### Contents

- **Week Two** <ul>
Week Two comprised of my basic git and github setup, testing forks and pushing commits through my text editor of choice, VS Code. Set up a basic file system with a singular folder and added some simple code to each.
</ul>
<br>

- **Week Three** <ul>
Completing lab exercises and code examples given in the lectures to see how they work and if they work. Also creating this readme.md file to add documentation to everything I create. Also set up a GitHub Pages if I wish to test my work on a website.
</ul>
<br>

- **Week Four** <ul>
Updated README.md file to include a checklist in order to keep track of my progress throughout the course. Implemented JQuery examples and tested them to deepen my understanding on the topic area. I wanted to try out a new file system for week four but may revert back to the original come week 5 start as it looks very cluttered. This week contains 4 short examples of JQuery in action. 
</ul>
<br>

- **Week Five** <ul>
This week is all about XML & RSS. The contents of this weeks folder will be general testing of XML & RSS. I have implemented a simple RSS feed using the fox news website and added my own layout to it using a flexbox.
</ul>
<br>

- **Week Six** <ul>
This week is consolidation week. I used the repository this week to revise on JQuery, XML and JSON. 
</ul>
