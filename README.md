Repository for F28WP. 

## About this Repository
This repository is for the F28WP course. Here you will find __HTML__, __CSS__ and mainly __JavaScript__. You will also be able to find examples of __JSON__, __XML__ and __AJAX__. This repository has been made to test my knowledge of GitHub and is assessed over the entirety of the course. Contents of the repository are listed below as well as a checklist so I can keep track of my progress on knowledge of GitHub.

You can also find the course contents at the bottom of this file so you can see what is used within the files within this repository.

### Contents

- **Week Two** <ul>
Week Two comprised of my basic git and github setup, testing forks and pushing commits through my text editor of choice, VS Code. Set up a basic file system with a singular folder and added some simple code to each.
</ul>
<br>

- **Week Three** <ul>
Completing lab exercises and code examples given in the lectures to see how they work and if they work. Also creating this readme.md file to add documentation to everything I create. Also set up a GitHub Pages if I wish to test my work on a website.
</ul>
<br>

- **Week Four** <ul>
Updated README.md file to include a checklist in order to keep track of my progress throughout the course. Implemented JQuery examples and tested them to deepen my understanding on the topic area. I wanted to try out a new file system for week four but may revert back to the original come week 5 start as it looks very cluttered. This week contains 4 short examples of JQuery in action. 
</ul>
<br>

- **Week Five** <ul>
This week is all about XML & RSS. The contents of this weeks folder will be general testing of XML & RSS. I have implemented a simple RSS feed using the fox news website and added my own layout to it using a flexbox.
</ul>
<br>

- **Week Six** <ul>
This week is consolidation week. I used the repository this week to do a JQuery example and add images to my repository that I might use in my README file. They are in html format but will be changed so they can be viewed in image format on github at some point.

I looked a bit into pull requests and branching and will be experimenting more with these next week.
</ul>
<br>

- **Week Seven** <ul>
This week has a small repository as I only looked at Sessional and Local Storage along with cookies. Some examples can be found in the Week Seven folder. I used this week to also look into .gitignore files and created a test file. I will be using one of these next week for NodeJS.
</ul>
<br>

- **Week Eight** <ul>
The repository this week is all about NodeJS and investigating it and getting to know about it better. There will be a a lot of examples from the lecture slides located in the Week Eight folder. I have used a branch this week in order to show my knowledge which I created inside github called "week 8" and switched to it in VSCode using the git checkout "week 8" command. All of the NodeJS material, including last weeks is located in this folder.

I want to show my knowledge on branches so each week from now on will be created using a branch. 
</ul>
<br>

- **Week Nine** <ul>
The repository this week was blank due to a problem with the course so this week was spent reviewing previous content in the repository and just revising the general material. 
</ul>
<br>

- **Week Ten** <ul>
The course has resumed so this weeks repository contains more NodeJS stuff. I have merged the week 8 branch to the main as well as updating the course checklist found below. This weeks material is NodeJS & DB so that is what will be found here.
</ul>
