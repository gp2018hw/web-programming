Repository for F28WP. 

### Contents

- **Week Two**
Week Two comprised of my basic git and github setup, testing forks and pushing commits through my text editor of choice, VS Code.

Set up a basic file system with a singular folder and added some simple code to each.

- **Week Three**
Completing lab exercises and code examples given in the lectures to see how they work and if they work. Also creating this readme.md file to add documentation to everything I create.
